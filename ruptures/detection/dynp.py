"""
For a given model and known number of change points, the change point detection problem amounts to
minimize the approximation error over all the potential breakpoint repartitions.
Thanks to the additive nature of the change point detection problem, a dynamic programming
algorithm is able to find the optimal partition which minimizes a sum of costs measuring
approximation error.
Formally,

.. math:: \widehat{\mathbf{p}}_K = \\arg \min_{\mathbf{p}} \sum_{i=1}^{K} c(y_{p_i}).

The method is implemented in :class:`ruptures.detection.Dynp`.

.. _sec-costs:

Available cost functions:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Squared residuals:
    .. math:: c(y_{p_i}) = \sum_{t\in p_i} \|y_t - \\bar{y}\|^2_2

    where :math:`\\bar{y}=\\frac{1}{|p_i|} \sum\limits_{t\in p_i} y_t`.

    This cost function is suited to approximate piecewise constant signals corrupted with noise.

- Absolute deviation:
    .. math:: c(y_{p_i}) = \min_u \sum_{t\in p_i} \|y_t - u\|_1

    This cost function is suited to approximate piecewise constant signals corrupted with
    non-Gaussian noise (following for instance a heavy-tailed distribution).

- Negative maximum log-likelihood (Gaussian density):
    .. math:: c(y_{p_i}) = |p_i| \log\det\widehat{\Sigma}_i

    where :math:`\widehat{\Sigma} = \\frac{1}{|p_i|}\sum\limits_{t\in p_i} (y_t - \\bar{y}) (y_t - \\bar{y})^T`.

    This cost function is suited to approximate piecewise i.i.d. Gaussian variables, for instance
    mean-shifts and scale-shifts.
